    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Content Writing & Communication Skills</h3>
    <p>
I started my professional journey as a Content Writer at Brihaspati Technologies, where I built a strong foundation in creating clear, engaging, and impactful content. My role involved writing articles, blogs, and technical documents that not only informed but also connected with the target audience. This experience honed my ability to communicate complex ideas in a simple and effective manner, a skill I continue to apply across different projects.    </p>
    </p>
    <h3>Digital Marketing Experience</h3>
    <p>
      Alongside writing, I developed a keen interest in Digital Marketing, where I learned how content and strategy go hand in hand. I gained hands-on experience in campaign management, online visibility, and brand positioning. My ability to blend content with marketing strategies allowed me to understand how businesses grow digitally and how to leverage platforms for maximum impact.
    </p>
    <h3>Growth & Social Media Management</h3>
    <p>
     At TrendTiger, an educational app development company, I worked as a Growth Analyst. Here, I managed the companyâ€™s social media accounts, designed growth strategies, and tracked performance metrics to improve engagement. By creating relevant campaigns and interacting with audiences, I helped boost the brandâ€™s online presence and reach, giving me valuable experience in social media management and growth analytics. 
    </p>
    <h3>Technical Writing & Branding Support</h3>
    <p>
     Later, I contributed as a Technical Writer at Hogar Controls, where I created technical documents, client presentations, and marketing materials for IoT-based products. This role deepened my understanding of technical communication and also gave me the opportunity to support branding and client communication through well-structured documentation and presentation design. 
    </p>
     <h3>Creative Projects & Personal Initiatives</h3>
    <p>
      Beyond professional roles, I explore my creativity through personal projects. I have built websites using AI tools, designed social media creatives on Canva, and even run my own YouTube channel, where one of my videos crossed 40,000 views. These experiences reflect my ability to adapt, create, and engage with digital audiences, showcasing my versatility across content creation, marketing, design, and growth.
